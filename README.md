# Univalued-Binary-Tree-Check

Problem Overview
Given a binary tree, determine whether all nodes contain the same value.

Key Insights
Simple Concept, Important Fundamentals: While straightforward, this problem is excellent for practicing tree traversal techniques
Efficiency Matters: The optimal solution visits each node exactly once
Edge Case Handling: Properly handles empty trees and single-node cases

Learning Outcomes
Recursive Tree Traversal: Strengthens understanding of DFS
Problem Decomposition: Breaking down the check into smaller subproblems
Boolean Logic in Trees: Learning to propagate checks through recursive calls

Try It Yourself
Consider various test cases (empty tree, single node, full tree)
Think about both recursive and iterative approaches
Challenge: Can you solve it with O(1) space (excluding recursion stack)?
Perfect for interview prep and algorithm practice! ðŸŒŸ
